            While at school and in the 5th grade, it has been observed that Katrinaâ€™s son, Nelson, has been demonstrating disruptive
             behavior, anger, and poor frustration tolerance in the classroom. Nelson was subsequently referred to the school counselor who met with Nelson on a few occasions.
             Nelson indicated that his parents are separated and that he primarily lives with his mother, who tends to become easily frustrated with him due to his behavior and there appears 
             to be a lot of conflict in the home. The school counselor made contact with Katrina and recommended that the family receive services from a local community mental health agency and Katrina agreed to 
             receive a home visit from the case manager.
