    <div id="aboutText" class="aboutText">
        This simulation game was developed specifically for use in the RHS 401 Community Mental Health Practices and Services course offered at Penn State University.  
        This simulation promotes the application of knowledge and skills learned throughout the course that relate to establishing a therapeutic relationship between a clinician and client, assessment and interviewing skills, ethical standards and guidelines, and general safety practices and crisis management.  
        In this simulation, students will assume the role of a case manager working at a community mental health agency who is assigned to conduct a home visit.
